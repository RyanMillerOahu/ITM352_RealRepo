    <p>The project which became <a
            href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/campaign/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand-US-GGL-Exact&utm_term=fire%20fox&utm_content=A144_A203_A006293&gclsrc=aw.ds&&&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxL6PoJu75AIViK_sCh0Z-AX3EAAYASAAEgKOWPD_BwE">Firefox</a>
        started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). After it had been
        sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.

    <p>Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking
        enabled by default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control
        attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element,
        the restriction to have to "switch to a different search provider across the entire browser," and a global
        browser console, a new network monitor among other things.
