    <p>Google's Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at
        the time, Google was a small company," and he did not want to go through "bruising browser wars." After
        co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of
        Chrome, however, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind."

    <p>In December 2010 <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> announced that to make it easier for businesses
        to use Chrome they would provide an official Chrome MSI package. For business use it is helpful to have
        full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized via transform files (.mst) - but the MSI provided with Chrome
        is only a very limited MSI wrapper fitted around the normal installer, and many businesses find that this
        arrangement does not meet their needs.
